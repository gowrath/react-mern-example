# MERN - CRUD App 


Created using this tutorial: https://www.positronx.io/react-mern-stack-crud-app-tutorial/

This is a React application written in class components with React Router v5. It uses Express as middleware. 

It uses MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database, making deployment easier. 

I used Axios to handle POST and GET and SET requests. Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations.

Node + Express is my middleware/server. I have it running on Heroku.

It is hosted on Firebase:
